### Level Design and Goals
- The game is structured in levels
- The levels are predesigned and loaded.
- The goal is to reach the end of the level and kill enemies on the way
- The player is rewarded for killing enemies
- The player is rewarded for completing the level in proper timing: there is a gold, silver, and bronze medal for time completion; it is possible to get no medal.

### Main Character Design
- Character is a human dressed in black and body armor / bullet-proof vest
- When player dies, character respawns at same spot 
- The character can only hold one weapon at a time
- The weapons can be melee or ranged
- Weapons are found across level and are randomly generated
- Weapons are found inside crates on the ground
- There are various pick-ups that are randomly generated with a probability chance after killing each enemy

### Enemy Design
- There are regular enemies and then boss enemies
- Enemies can fly or walk according to type
- Some enemies have immunity to weapon types; sometimes the player will not have the means to kill them -- in that scenario, he is to avoid them
- Every level contains a boss
- Enemies become incrementally harder to kill after each boss defeat

### Enemy Types
- Three enemies killed by any weapon
- Two enemies immune to ranged weapons (bullet armor)
- Two enemies immune to melee (flying)
- One enemy immune to all attacks (to be avoided)
- One general boss design (100% probability of spawn)
